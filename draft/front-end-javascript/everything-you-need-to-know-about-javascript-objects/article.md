# Basics

JavaScript is an object oriented programming language. Almost everything in JavaScript is an object, except these primitive data types: *number*, *string*, *boolean*, *null* and *undefined*. For instance, *functions* and *arrays* are objects, which have their own properties and methods. We will discuss about them later in this tutorial. Let's see, for beginning, what the objects are and how they can be created.

## What is an object?

Object is a collection of key/value pairs. Keys are also known as properties. An object can be empty, if it doesn't contain any key/value pair. For instance, this is an empty object:

``` JavaScript
var x = {};
```

This is an example of a simple object (`x` and `y` are properties which have values `5` and `"abc"`, respectively):
``` JavaScript
var a = {
    x: 5,
    y: "abc"
};
```
Every object has its prototype.

## What is a prototype?
The prototype is actually a base object which an object is inherited from. Objects `x` and `a` from the above examples are inherited from the [Object.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype), so they have access to all methods of the `Object.prototype`, beside access to their own properties.

## How objects can be instantiated?

There are several ways of creating new objects in JavaScript. We will start from the simplest one.

### Object literals

The most simple way of object creation is using the literal notation. Here are some examples:

```JavaScript
var emptyObject = {};

var person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Smith'
};

var employee = {
    id: '1',
    contactData: {
        email: test@test.com
        phone: 062345678
    },
    isFullTimeEmployee: true
}
```

Objects can be nested into each other, like the `contactData` in the `employee` object. Even an empty object actually has access to  methods of the [Object.prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/prototype). One of those methods is the `toString` method, so, we could execute, for instance, this line of code:
``` JavaScript
console.log(emptyObject.toString());
```
and get the following output in the console:
```
[object Object]
```

The `[object Object]` means that the `emptyObject` is an `object` which prototype is the `Object.prototype`. There are different types of object in JavaScript (functions, arrays, dates etc.), so we should get different results in the console for different types of object.

We could initialze the *person* object in the above example in the following way, as well:
```JavaScript
var person = {};

person['firstName'] = 'John';
person['lastName'] = 'Smith';
```

So, we can use square brackets to access (or create) object properties. They do the same thing as the *dot* operator does, but they are useful if a property needs to be the result of an expression. For instance, this code will also work:

```JavaScript
var nameSuffix = 'Name';

var person = {};

person['first' + nameSuffix] = 'John';
person['last' + nameSuffix] = 'Smith';
```
