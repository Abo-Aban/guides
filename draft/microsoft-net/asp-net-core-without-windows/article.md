# Introduction

When .NET Core was announced at Visual Studio Connect() in 2014, one of the most exciting features was that it would be supported across multiple platforms namely Windows, macOS and various distributions of Linux.  However, this also introducted a challenge, which was tooling.  The preferred tool for writing ASP.NET applications at the time was Visual Studio, running on Windows, deploying to Windows.  What would the tooling and developer experience look like in the abscence of Windows?

At the annual Microsoft Build developer conference, six months later in April 2015, Microsoft introduced the world to Visual Studio Code.  Inspired by Visual Studio for Windows, Visual Studio Code is a lightweight text editor which is both free and cross-platform with builds for Windows, macOS and Linux which are conveniently the same platforms targeted by .NET Core.  Built on the Electron shell from Github and written in TypeScript, Visual Studio Code is not even a .NET application, even on Windows.  Eventually, Visual Studio Code was made open source on Github.  

With the addition of support for extension authoring, the capabilities of Visual Studio Code began to increase very quickly.  Today, with the help of extensions, Visual Studio Code is a major player and worthy competitor to other established editors including Visual Studio, Sublime Text and Atom.  This guide will look at what is needed to setup Visual Studio Code, along with the .NET Core SDK, on any of the three supported platforms to create a database-driven web application with a REST-ful API.

# Installation

Let's look at how to set up the development environment.  In addition to the .NET Core SDK and Visual Studio Code, you'll need Docker to run an instance of SQL Server.  I'll be using macOS here but the process will be similar for Windows as well.  Linux will also work but the Docker install will be slightly different.  This guide will focus on macOS and Windows.

### .NET Core

The home page for all things .NET (including .NET Core) is http://dot.net.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Figure 1 - The .NET home page**

Clicking on the *Downloads* link will take you to a page where you can select between the .NET Framework, .NET Core and Xamarin.  This guide will use .NET Core so click on that option.  The next page will have the downloads for the installers and binaries for the .NET Core SDK.  Scroll down to the bottom and find the section for *Step-by-step instructions*.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Figure 2 - Step by step instructions**

From here click on the link for your operating system.  Then on the next page follow the instructions to install the .NET Core SDK.  There are also instructions to test your new installation.  Follow these as well.  You now have the .NET Core SDK installed on your machine.

### Visual Studio Code
This one is easy.  Just go to http://code.visualstudio.com and download the installer for your operating system.

##### Visual Studio Code Extensions
This guide relies upon two extensions to Visual Studio Code, the first is the C# extension.  To install it, with Visual Studio Code open, click on the bottom icon in the left sidebar to open the Extensions panel.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Figure 4 - The Extensions panel**

In the Extensions panel, at the top, type 'C#' in the search bar and press the enter key.  The top result should be for the C# extension published by Microsoft.  Press the green Install button to install the extension.  After that, repeat by searching for the 'mssql' extension and installing it.  To finish the installations, press the Reload button to reload Visual Studio Code.

The C# extension will provide a developer experience closer to that of Visual Studio for Windows with syntax highlighting and Intellisense along with debugging support.  The mssql extension will turn Visual Studio Code into a client for Microsoft SQL Server.

### Docker

If you already have access to a Microsoft SQL Server database, you can skip this section although if you want the true cross platform effect of ASP.NET Core, I recommend you follow along.  

Docker is a container host which virtualizes applications.  It is simiiar to a virtual machine, but more lightweight.  The application that this guide uses Docker to virtualize will be Microsoft SQL Server for Linux.  Yes, you read that correctly.  Microsoft SQL Server now supports Linux.  

To get Docker, go to the Docker home page at http://www.docker.com and under the *Get Docker* link at the top of the page, click on the link for your operating system.  Docker runs natively on Linux but there are environments for running containers on Windows and macOS and that is what the installers provide.  After the installation is complete, click on the Docker icon (in the system tray on Windows and the menu bar on macOS) and select the Kitematic menu item.  This will prompt you to install Kitematic, a GUI for Docker on Windows and macOS.  (FYI: Like Visual Studio Code, Kitematic is also an Electron application.)

With Kitematic installed and open, search for 'mssql' in the search bar.  Then find the item for 'mssql-server-linux' and click the Create button.

This will begin the download of the container image for SQL Server for Linux.
