##Let's begin

###FYI - I scraped my data from a Destiny Stat Tracker

I am taking Game Stats and using Pygal to display it etc.  

```
import pygal 
```

Pygal has a lot of options and customizations.  For now we will just use a Bar Chart and later on a Stacked Bar Chart.

Pygal is pretty simplistic with it's naming conventions


<li>Bar Chart = Pygal.Bar()
<li>Line Chart = Pygal.Line() 
<li>and so on. 
</li>
Full list can be found here:  http://pygal.org/en/stable/documentation/index.html

    <?php
        echo "Hello world!";
    ?>
