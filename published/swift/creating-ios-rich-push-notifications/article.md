These days, having a visually stunning mobile app isnâ€™t good enough. For your mobile app to see success, it must be designed with user experience (UX) in mind. Push Notifications are a *great* means of interacting with consumers even when they are not using the application.

This guide will walk you through setting up your project for rich push notifications, you will learn some server-side requirements and we will peek into the infinite possibilities!


## Setup

In order to get started with push notifications, you need to follow these steps:


1.  Open an existing Xcode project or create a new project. Select your project target and go to Capabilities to enable Push Notifications as shown [here](https://docs.centroida.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/1-step-enable-PN-in-Capabilities-300x77.png). 
2. Open **Keychain Access > Certificate Assistant > Request a Certificate From a Certificate Authority...** Fill the required fields and choose either to email CA the request or save it to disk. Go to [your Apple member center](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/identifier/bundle) and locate your App ID. You will see that "Push Notifications" service is now *Configurable*. Select the ` Edit` button. Under Push Notifications section there are two options for certificates as shown [here](https://docs.centroida.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/3-step-create-certificate-300x183.png). Select the **Create Certificate** button to create your Certificate.

 > **Development Certificate** - App built from Xcode will receive notifications.

 > **Production Certificate** -App installed from Apple Store or Test Flight will receive notifications.

3. Upload your *.certSigningRequest* file that you prevously saved on disk or emailed the Certificate Authority, download your generated Certificate, and double-click the *.cer* file to install it in your Keychain Access.
4. Locate your Certificate in Keychain Access under
    "Certificates" section and export it as shown [here](https://docs.centroida.co/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/4d-Export-the-cert-from-Keychain.png)
Your Certificate is now saved as .p12 file. If you need your Certificate as `.pem/.p8` file you can easy convert it
```
    $ openssl pkcs12 -in CertName.p12 -out CertName.pem -nodes -clcerts
```

## Registering for push notifications

Simply as that in your AppDelegate file:

```
import UIKit
import UserNotifications

@UIApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate, UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate {

    var window: UIWindow?

func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {

    UNUserNotificationCenter.current().delegate = self

    if #available(iOS 10, *) {
        UNUserNotificationCenter.current().requestAuthorization(options:[.badge, .alert, .sound]) { granted, error in }
    } else {
       application.registerUserNotificationSettings(UIUserNotificationSettings(types: [.badge, .sound, .alert], categories: nil))
    }
    application.registerForRemoteNotifications()
    return true
 }
...

```
Add the `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` function in your AppDelegate.swift file to get the deviceToken, which will receive notifications.

```
...
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
   let deviceTokenString = deviceToken.reduce("") { $0 + String(format: "%02X", $1) }
   print("APNs device token: \(deviceTokenString)")
}
...
```

Awesome! Now it's time to make them super duper nice-looking. ðŸ™€

## Displaying push notifications

> Your notifications interface should feel like natural extension of your containing app!

A very important step for sending media attachment is the `mutable-content` key in the push payload from the server. So let's take a look at this example payload.

<div class="code-snippet">
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="json">
{
   "aps": {
       "alert": "Hello!",
       "sound": "default",
       "mutable-content": 1,
       "badge": 1
   },
   "data": {
       "attachment-url": "https://example.com/attachment.jpg"
   }
}
</code></pre>
</div>


From **Xcode > File > New > Target...**, select *Notification Service Extension* and activate suggested scheme. Notice that there are two autogenerated files now - `NotificationService.swift` and `Info.plist.`

In the `NotificationService.swift` file, we need to handle the media URL from the payload. For example, we can use FileManager:

```
...
override func didReceive(_ request: UNNotificationRequest, withContentHandler contentHandler: @escaping (UNNotificationContent) -> Void) {
        self.contentHandler = contentHandler
        bestAttemptContent = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent)

        func failEarly() {
            contentHandler(request.content)
        }

        guard let content = (request.content.mutableCopy() as? UNMutableNotificationContent) else {
            return failEarly()
        }

        guard let apnsData = content.userInfo["data"] as? [String: Any] else {
            return failEarly()
        }

        guard let attachmentURL = apnsData["attachment-url"] as? String else {
            return failEarly()
        }

        guard let imageData = NSData(contentsOf:NSURL(string: attachmentURL)! as URL) else { return failEarly() }
        guard let attachment = UNNotificationAttachment.create(imageFileIdentifier: "image.gif", data: imageData, options: nil) else { return failEarly() }

        content.attachments = [attachment]
        contentHandler(content.copy() as! UNNotificationContent)
    }
...
```

... and this `UNNotificationAttachment`extension function to save the media to disk:

```
extension UNNotificationAttachment {
    static func create(imageFileIdentifier: String, data: NSData, options: [NSObject : AnyObject]?) -> UNNotificationAttachment? {

            let fileManager = FileManager.default
            let tmpSubFolderName = ProcessInfo.processInfo.globallyUniqueString
            let fileURLPath      = NSURL(fileURLWithPath: NSTemporaryDirectory())
            let tmpSubFolderURL  = fileURLPath.appendingPathComponent(tmpSubFolderName, isDirectory: true)

            do {
                try fileManager.createDirectory(at: tmpSubFolderURL!, withIntermediateDirectories: true, attributes: nil)
                let fileURL = tmpSubFolderURL?.appendingPathComponent(imageFileIdentifier)
                try data.write(to: fileURL!, options: [])
                let imageAttachment = try UNNotificationAttachment.init(identifier: imageFileIdentifier, url: fileURL!, options: options)
                return imageAttachment
            } catch let error {
                print("error \(error)")
            }

        return nil
    }
}
```

Voila!

## Adding actions to push notifications

Let's add some actions to our Rich Push Notifications. Modify the payload by adding the "category" key to notify that we want to display actions.

```
{
   "aps": {
       "alert": "Hello!",
       "sound": "default",
       "mutable-content": 1,
       "badge": 1,
       "category": "myCategoryName"
   },
   "data": {
       "attachment-url": "https://example.com/attachment.jpg"
   }
}
```
In the autogenerated Notification Service `Info.plist`, add an UNNotificationExtensionCategory array with up to 4 action identifiers. These can be seen as "Item 0" and "Item 1" in the picture below:

![UNNotificationExtensionCategory items](https://s4.postimg.org/k1find9z1/PN_Service_plist_for_actions.png)

Adjust the notification category in your `didReceiveRequest` function in the `NotificationService.swift` file:

<div class="code-snippet">
  <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-swift">
...
let meowAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "meow", title: "Meow", options: [])
let pizzaAction = UNNotificationAction(identifier: "pizza", title: "Pizza?", options: [])

let category = UNNotificationCategory(identifier: "myCategoryName", actions: [meowAction, pizzaAction], intentIdentifiers: [], options: [])
UNUserNotificationCenter.current().setNotificationCategories([category])
...
</code></pre>
</div>

Simple as that! ðŸŽ‰
Time for a preview:

![Rich Push Notifications - Actions](https://media.giphy.com/media/xUPGcqdPpl58N3v8dy/giphy.gif)

Finally, add the logic for the notifications buttons in the `AppDelegate.swift` file, using the identifiers that we specified in the `Info.plist` file earlier. The method we call is **didReceive response** from the `UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate`

```
...
func userNotificationCenter(_ center: UNUserNotificationCenter, didReceive response: UNNotificationResponse, withCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping () -&gt; Void) {

        if response.actionIdentifier == "meow" {
            ...
        }
        if response.actionIdentifier == "pizza" {
            ...
        }
        completionHandler()
    }
...
```


>  Warning! Don't forget to update the badge icon number when needed!


```
application.applicationIconBadgeNumber = 0
```

## Custom preview

 Last, but not least, let's add a custom preview for notifications from **Xcode > File > New > Target...** select *Notification Content* and activate suggested scheme. Now we have `NotificationViewController.swift`, `MainInterface.storyboard` and `Info.plist` files.
